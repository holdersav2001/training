First, make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can check this by running:
Copypython --version

It's recommended to use a virtual environment to keep your project dependencies isolated. Create and activate a virtual environment:
On Windows:
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate


Now, install the required packages:
pip install elasticsearch faker

If you encounter any issues with the installation, you might need to upgrade pip:
pip install --upgrade pip

After installation, verify that the packages are installed correctly:
pip list
You should see elasticsearch and faker in the list.
Now try running your script again:

python job_run_data_generator.py


If you still encounter issues, please let me know the specific error message, and I'll help you troubleshoot further.
Also, make sure your Elasticsearch Docker container is running and accessible. You can check this by running:
curl http://localhost:9200
This should return some JSON with Elasticsearch version information if it's running correctly.
If you're not familiar with using virtual environments or pip, or if you're new to Python development, please let me know, and I can provide more detailed explanations or alternative approaches.
