Data Generation Plan
1. Job Run Data

Generate 10,000 job runs with varying:

Durations (1 minute to 24 hours)
Statuses (80% completed, 15% failed, 5% running)
Resource usage patterns
Log verbosity levels



2. Error Scenarios

Create 100 unique error types with:

Error messages
Probable causes
Resolution steps


Generate 1,000 error logs incorporating these scenarios

3. Job Schedules

Create 50 job schedules, each with:

10-50 jobs
Complex dependencies
Planned vs actual execution times



4. Natural Language Query Dataset

Develop 500 natural language queries covering:

Job status inquiries
Performance questions
Error troubleshooting requests


Create corresponding structured answers

5. System Metrics

Generate time-series data for system metrics:

CPU, Memory, Disk I/O, Network
5-minute intervals over 6 months



6. Code Snippets

Create 200 job code snippets in various languages
Include both optimized and unoptimized versions
Associate performance metrics with each version

7. Compliance Policies

Define 20 compliance policies
Generate 5,000 job runs with varying compliance levels

8. User Interaction Logs

Simulate 1,000 user sessions with:

Feature usage data
Time spent on different pages
Click patterns



9. Documentation Components

Create outlines for 50 system components
Generate usage statistics for each component

10. Historical Performance Data

Generate performance data for 1,000 jobs across:

5 different system configurations
12 months of historical data



Data Generation Tools

Use Python libraries like Faker for synthetic data
Employ time-series generation tools for metrics
Utilize NLP models for generating varied log messages

Data Storage

Store structured data in a relational database
Use Elasticsearch for log data and full-text search
Employ a time-series database for metrics data

Data Validation

Implement data validation scripts to ensure:

Consistency across related data points
Realistic distributions of values
Proper formatting of all generated data



This plan provides a comprehensive blueprint for generating a rich dataset that covers all 12 use cases of the RAG-enhanced job monitoring system.
